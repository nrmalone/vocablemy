# Vocablemy
## Description
**Vocablemy** is a simple word-building game written in Python meant to test the user's knowledge of the English lexicon. Each round the user must use a randomly picked consonant and vowel to create a word. The minimum length of the word goes up each round and three invalid inputs or passes means game over!
## Dependencies
- [*Kivy*](https://kivy.org/#home) for a future-proofed, cross-platform UI (plus it'll be a learning experience for me)
*there will likely be more dependencies as time goes on.
## Special Thanks
